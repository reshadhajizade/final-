            <p>Simbrella has donated to forest restoration project via partnership with One Tree Planted and the Jane Goodall Institute. The primary goal of this project is to support long-term and large-scale restoration of selected Albertine Rift forests in Uganda through a public-private partnership for forest restoration and management.<br>
  <br>
  Rehabilitation of the land will be achieved by the planting of mixed local native trees to create conservation forests. Additionally, the restored community forests will be buffered by a combination of community agroforestry woodlots, and plantation of selected fast-growing timber/fuelwood species to ensure sustainability, provide alternatives to fuel/wood needs, and ultimately provide significant ecological, socio-economic, and cultural benefits.</p>
  
  <p>Our donation helped One Tree Planted and the Jane Goodall Institute to plant 1,000 trees in Albertine Rift forests. Simbrella is happy to contribute to the activities that enhance our society and environment. In future, Simbrella will continue to participate in the projects that promise better future for our world.</p> </div>
